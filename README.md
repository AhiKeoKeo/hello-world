How can only the parts that people have difficulty understanding be parables, yet the book in it's entirety is word for word truth??
What if satan turned his back on god to save the humans
he was cast to earth to rule over it
if there is a hell we were born into it
that would make the eternal flame our human paradox
born terminal, knowing that what we become comfortable with and grow to know will be lost forever
nothing is good enough, when we accomplish a goal we can not stop, we have to continue to build
so one who can give that up is the enlightened one. 
that's how you win, no expectations. Expectations only lead to disappointment, because accomplishing a goal will never be enough and losing sucks
to be consious and not give in to the need to build to try and overcome our demise
no not fall victim to time
Being present/mindful allows you to see the future. 
everything goes in circles/ everything comes in waves
sine is overcame by cosine/ covid shows the sin in people
now i'm going off topic but tis was a god thought process. i wish i wasn't so busy but i'm only human/ have to make money to eat
atleast that's how they've brainwashed me into thinking
